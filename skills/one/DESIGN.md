## Components

### Ghost Contact Button (Light)

**Role:** Interactive element (primary)

A ghost button for primary actions on light backgrounds. Features rounded corners at 999px, a border of 1px solid Midnight Void (#000000), and Ghost Outline (#fbfbfa) text. Padding is 0px top/bottom, 19.2px left/right.

### Ghost Contact Button (Dark)

**Role:** Interactive element (secondary)

A ghost button for secondary actions or contact calls to action on dark backgrounds. Features rounded corners at 999px, a border of 1px solid Ghost Outline (#fbfbfa), and Ghost Outline (#fbfbfa) text. Padding is 0px top/bottom, 28px left/right.

### Video Player Card

**Role:** Content display

A card component designed to frame video or image content. Has a Midnight Void (#000000) background, a border-radius of 12px, and no visible box shadow. Padding is 0px on all sides, allowing content to stretch to the edges.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Always use Midnight Void (#000000) as the dominant background color to maintain the dark, immersive feel.
- Frame primary visual content with a 12px border-radius, as seen in the Video Player Card component, for a consistent soft-edged presentation.
- Utilize Ghost Outline (#fbfbfa) exclusively for outlining interactive elements to preserve the minimalist aesthetic.
- Apply MagicUiPro with a -0.0100em letter-spacing to all text elements to establish a precise, uniform typographic voice.
- Maintain generous section spacing of 96px to create clear content separation and a spacious layout.
- Employ the 999px border-radius for all interactive buttons and tags to ensure a consistent pill-shaped form.
- Use Muted Ash (#bec0c5) for secondary text or subtle decorative lines to provide visual hierarchy without strong contrast.

### Don't

- Do not introduce strong accent colors in large blocks; color should act as functional punctuation, not primary decoration.
- Avoid heavy drop shadows or complex elevation; the design relies on flat surfaces and minimal depth.
- Do not deviate from the MagicUiPro font or its specified letter-spacing; it is central to the typographic identity.
- Refrain from using tight component and section spacing; the system prioritizes breathability and space.
- Do not use solid background buttons for primary calls to action; stick to ghost or outlined styles.
- Avoid sharp, un-rounded corners on significant content blocks like cards or media containers.
- Do not mix text colors for primary content; stick to Midnight Void (#000000) on light elements or Ghost Outline (#fbfbfa) on dark elements for readability.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | Midnight Canvas | #000000 | The primary background for the entire application, creating an immersive, dark environment. |

## Imagery

This design system heavily features large-format video content or striking photography, typically presented in full-width or near full-width frames. Visuals are contained within soft 12px rounded rectangles, giving them a cinematic yet approachable feel. The focus is on the visual itself, often abstract or concept-driven, serving as atmospheric backdrops or direct content. Icons are minimal, outlined, and monochromatic, integrated seamlessly into the UI.

## Layout

The page structure is full-bleed, with video content often spanning the entire viewport width, giving a sense of immersion. There is a strong emphasis on vertical stacking of content with generous section gaps of 96px, creating a spacious and unhurried rhythm. The header is minimal, featuring only a logo and a ghost contact button. Content is primarily centered or presented in balanced, often video-dominant, blocks. The text 'ONE is...' section showcases a distinct, multi-column grid for textual content, but maintains a wide, quiet layout.
