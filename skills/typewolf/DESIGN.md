## Overview

**North Star:** Letterpress on aged paper. This design feels like pages from an expertly printed, well-loved typography textbook.

This design system evokes the tactile quality of a letterpress studio, balancing classic elegance with a distinct, almost academic feel. A highly restrained palette of mauves and desaturated grays, anchored by a creamy off-white background, defines its sophisticated, understated mood. The interplay of custom serif and sans-serif fonts, particularly a heavy sans-serif with subtle negative letter-spacing for accents, establishes an intellectual yet approachable tone, akin to a well-curated typographic journal.

### Do's

- Use Cream Canvas (#f8f5f5) as the default page background to establish the site's light, subtle aesthetic.
- Apply Charcoal Text (#2e2c2c) for primary headlines and Inkwell Gray (#443235) for body text, maintaining contrast and readability.
- Emphasize interactive elements and calls to action with Rosewood CTA (#916a70) as the background color for primary buttons.
- Utilize Dia 900 font with -0.03em letter-spacing for all navigation items and concise, impactful labels.
- Maintain a default border radius of 0px for most elements to reinforce the crisp, structured aesthetic, only deviating to 4px for specific components where a subtle break is required.
- Apply the shadow rgba(145, 106, 112, 0.15) 0px 6px 24px 0px for elevated content cards, ensuring subtle depth without harshness.
- Employ DomaineText at 14-18px for body and descriptive text to maintain the editorial and inviting tone.

### Don'ts

- Avoid using highly saturated, vibrant colors; stick to the muted, near-gray, and earthy tones defined in the palette.
- Do not introduce rounded corners arbitrarily; reserve the 4px radius only where explicitly defined for small, functional elements.
- Refrain from using excessively bold weights for body text; DomaineText 400 is sufficient for paragraphs.
- Do not deviate from the specified letter-spacing for Dia font; the -0.03em is integral to its distinctive appearance.
- Do not use dark backgrounds for main content areas; the design is firmly built on a light theme with Cream Canvas and Cloud White surfaces.
- Avoid generic, system fonts; prioritize DomaineText, Dia, and DomaineDisplayNarrow to preserve the site's unique typographic identity.
- Do not use box-shadows on individual text elements; reserve them for content containers like cards for subtle elevation.

### Layout

The page primarily uses a max-width contained model, with content centered. The hero section features a centered headline and subtitle over the Cream Canvas background. Content sections generally consist of a grid of cards, often two columns wide, each card presenting a distinct article or resource. Each card is a self-contained unit with its own content and visual treatment. There's a consistent vertical rhythm of spacing between elements and sections, contributing to an organized, readable flow. Navigation is a minimalist top-bar with horizontally listed links, and a prominent header introducing the brand. The layout is information-dense yet visually uncluttered.

### Imagery

This site features illustrations and product screenshots, all contained within specific sections or cards. Illustrations are line-art based, often black or brand-colored on a solid, muted background (like the orange card background). Photography, when present, appears to be product-focused (e.g., large letterforms, type specimens). The overall treatment is contained and isolated, with no full-bleed or overlapping imagery. Images serve an explanatory or decorative role within their content blocks, enhancing the editorial feel rather than dominating the layout. Icons are minimal, likely line-art to match the illustrations.
