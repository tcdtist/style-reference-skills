# teenage engineering — Style Reference

> engineered precision against industrial gray

**Theme:** light

**Industry:** other

This system feels like a minimalist architectural blueprint, where products are spotlighted against a backdrop of muted industrial grays. The deliberate use of extremely thin custom typography, particularly for headings, creates a subtle, almost whispered authority. Interactive elements are marked by a singular vivid blue against a monochromatic field, acting like technical indicator lights. Sharp angles and high-contrast text on neutral surfaces define the system's precise and functional aesthetic.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas | #f6f8f7 | `--color-canvas` | Page background, primary display surface. |
| Graphite | #0f0e12 | `--color-graphite` | Secondary surface, used for darker interactive states or background elements, often paired with lighter text. |
| Ink | #000000 | `--color-ink` | Primary text color for maximum contrast, borders, and some background elements in high-contrast sections. |

| Electric Blue | #0071bb | `--color-electric-blue` | Interactive elements, 'buy now' links, and accents. Its vividness draws attention to key actions. |

Text links using te-20 font at 13px, weight 300, color Ink (#000000) on Canvas background. On hover, the text color changes to Electric Blue (#0071bb).

### Product Grid Item

**Role:** Product display

Displays products with 'EP-133 K.O. II' as heading text in te-20, size 19px, color Ink (#000000). A 'buy now' link is shown in Electric Blue (#0071bb) at 13px. Background is Canvas (#f6f8f7) with solid borders in Smoke (#b2b2b2) or Steel (#e5e5e5), with an element gap of 15px.

### Footer Link

Links within the footer use te-20 font, Steel (#e5e5e5) text color on a Graphite (#0f0e12) background.

### Promotional Banner (Top)

**Role:** Brand communication

A full-width banner at the top of the page with a Graphite (#0f0e12) background, featuring white icons and text. Uses te-20 at various sizes for labels and descriptors.

### Cookie Consent Banner

**Role:** Legal disclosure

A triangular overlay with a yellow background, black border, and black text. Contains two functional buttons: 'settings' and 'accept all'. Black text on yellow background for readability.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Prioritize the ultra-light 'te-20' and 'te-40' typefaces, especially for headlines, to maintain the brand's understated authority.
- Use Electric Blue (#0071bb) exclusively for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Implement high-contrast pairings of Ink (#000000) text on Canvas (#f6f8f7) backgrounds for primary content.
- Define clear visual hierarchy through font weights (te-40 for main headings, te-20 for body and smaller elements), rather than size alone.
- Maintain generous spacing with 15px for element gaps and 66px for section gaps, contributing to the 'comfortable' density.
- Employ Steel (#e5e5e5) and Smoke (#b2b2b2) for subtle borders and muted text to provide visual structure without heavy lines.
- Leverage the Canvas (#f6f8f7) background as the primary stage, ensuring products and content remain the focal point.

### Don't

- Avoid using bold or heavy font weights for headlines; the brand identity is built on a whisper-thin typographic aesthetic.
- Do not introduce new vibrant colors outside of Electric Blue (#0071bb) for interactive elements, as this dilutes the monochromatic focus.
- Refrain from adding decorative shadows or complex embellishments; the design system favors clean, flat surfaces.
- Do not use Electric Blue (#0071bb) for non-interactive text or purely decorative elements, as it's reserved for action.
- Avoid excessive rounding of corners; the design system maintains sharp, precise edge treatments.
- Do not allow text to crowd; ensure ample 15px element spacing and 66px section padding is consistently applied.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Canvas | #f6f8f7 | Primary page background, light canvases for product display. |
| 2 | Graphite | #0f0e12 | Secondary background for navigation, footers, or sections intended to recede or provide contrast for lighter elements. |
| 3 | Ink | #000000 | High-contrast background for specific elements or headers within darker sections, providing maximum textual legibility against lighter content. |

## Imagery

The visual language focuses heavily on product photography, presenting devices in a precise, almost clinical manner. Products are often isolated or shown in context against plain, industrial gray or white backgrounds, emphasizing their form and detailing. The style is primarily clean and contained, with sharp edges and no visible rounding. Photography is brightly lit, showcasing product textures and features clearly, avoiding lifestyle contexts. Icons are minimalist, outlined, and monochromatic, often using Steel (#e5e5e5) on darker backgrounds or Ink (#000000) on lighter ones, serving a functional and informational role.

## Layout

The page primarily utilizes a max-width contained layout with centered content, though the main navigation and the hero section can stretch full-bleed visually. The hero typically features a large product image, often against a dark or gray background, with minimal, centered text elements. Sections maintain a consistent vertical rhythm, often separated by distinct background shifts between Canvas (#f6f8f7) and a darker neutral. Content is arranged in alternating image-left, text-right, or vice-versa patterns, and product displays often use a simple, predictable grid. Navigation is a prominent, full-width top bar, generally sticky or highly visible, using a high-contrast ink-on-canvas or steel-on-graphite palette.

- **Oura Ring** — Clean, device-centric product photography and a refined, subtle typographic approach within a light theme.
- **Minimalist websites for audio equipment brands generally** — Emphasis on showcasing the product itself, often with stark backgrounds and minimal UI interference.
