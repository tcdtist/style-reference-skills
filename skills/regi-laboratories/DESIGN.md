## Components

### Ghost Button

**Role:** Primary action, navigation items

Text in Muted Grey (#454545) with a bottom border in Ink Black (#000000) for active states. No background fill, creating a lightweight, ghost-like appearance. Padding is minimal (0px vertical, 22.4px horizontal).

### Circular Card

**Role:** Decorative or illustrative containers

Background is Surface Frost (#f5f7f8) with a 50% border radius to create a perfect circle. No box shadow, keeping it flat.

### Navigation Link

**Role:** Header and footer navigation

Text color is Muted Grey (#454545) for inactive states, changing to Graphite Text (#0f0f0f) on hover/active, with a discreet bottom border in Ink Black (#000000) for interaction states.

### Main Heading

**Role:** Hero section titles, major content blocks

Uses PP Woodland font, Ink Black (#000000) color, with large sizes (e.g., 64px) and a tight line-height of 0.97 to stack text compactly.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Use PP Woodland for all headings and large display text, ensuring line-height is 0.97 for sizes above 30px.
- Prioritize Ink Black (#000000) for primary text and borders, with Graphite Text (#0f0f0f) for links and Muted Grey (#454545) for secondary text.
- Implement lightweight, ghost-style buttons with Muted Grey (#454545) text and Ink Black (#000000) bottom borders for interactive elements.
- Maintain a clear separation between the Canvas White (#ffffff) background and Surface Frost (#f5f7f8) for card elements.
- Apply a 50% border radius to any background boxes that function as cards or decorative elements.
- Emphasize whitespace, using 'elementGap' of 16px and 'sectionGap' of 76px to create natural breaks and visual breathing room.
- Integrate the 'Sky Haze Gradient' as a subtle, background atmospheric effect rather than a prominent UI component.

### Don't

- Avoid solid background colors for interactive elements, favoring ghost buttons with borders as the primary action style.
- Do not introduce strong, saturated colors for backgrounds or large sections; maintain the achromatic base palette.
- Refrain from using prominent box-shadows or heavy elevation effects; surfaces should remain flat or with minimal visual depth.
- Do not deviate from the PP Woodland and Roboto font families; avoid system defaults or other decorative fonts.
- Avoid large contiguous blocks of text without sufficient line-height (1.5 for Roboto) or padding.
- Do not use generic square corners for cards or prominent containers; rely on the subtle radius for cards and zero radius for buttons.
- Never use the Swiper Blue (#007aff) directly in UI elements unless it's an underlying framework component.

## Imagery

This design system favors an imagery-light approach, with the focus remaining on typography and subtle background gradients. Any graphical elements are primarily functional icons or abstract, decorative arrows, maintaining a clean and uncluttered presentation. Where imagery would typically appear, it is either absent or implied through abstract visual textures, allowing the information and brand voice to lead. Icons appear as minimal outlines, rendered in Ink Black.

## Layout

The page maintains a centered, maximal-width layout, with content contained within a comfortable reading measure that is not explicitly fixed but appears consistently aligned. The hero section makes use of the full viewport, featuring large centered headlines against the ephemeral radial gradient background. Section rhythm is open and spacious, with implied vertical sections rather than overt dividers. Content arrangement is primarily centered or implicitly balanced through typography and sparse elements, suggesting a focus on showcasing text-based information. Navigation consists of a minimal top bar with ghost-like links and a hamburger menu icon. The footer is also minimal, containing legal links and 'coming soon' placeholders.
