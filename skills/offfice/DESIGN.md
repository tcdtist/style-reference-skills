# OFFFICE : — Style Reference

> Black Box Gallery; objects artfully framed within a deep, dark void, highlighted by stark text.

**Theme:** dark

**Industry:** agency

This design system evokes a moody, high-end gallery experience where objects are presented with sculptural focus. The stark black background and minimal typographic hierarchy create a sophisticated, almost reverent atmosphere, allowing the furniture pieces to command attention through their form and subtle shading. Predominantly large, custom typography dominates the layout, serving as both content and graphic element, making the interface feel less like a website and more like a curated exhibition space. The limited interactivity is precisely indicated by subtle text changes, maintaining an air of exclusivity and quiet contemplation.

| Exhibition White | #fefefe | `--color-exhibition-white` | Primary text color for headlines, body copy, and interactive elements. Its near-pure white provides maximum contrast against the Void Black, ensuring legibility and drama. |

### Navigation Link

**Role:** Interactive text link

### Hero Headline

**Role:** Dominant page title

Large text using ak font, 216px, weight 400, in Exhibition White (#fefefe), with extremely tight line height (0.80) to overlap characters vertically, creating a dense typographic block.

### Body Text

**Role:** Standard paragraph text

Text using ak font, 14px, weight 400, in Exhibition White (#fefefe), with a comfortable line height (1.56) for readability against the dark background.

### Small Detail Text

**Role:** Metadata or secondary information

Text using ak font, 12px, weight 400, in Exhibition White (#fefefe), often used for dates, categories, or subtle descriptions.

### Project Title (List)

**Role:** Items in a project list

Text using ak font, 58px, weight 400, in Exhibition White (#fefefe), with a line height of 0.90. These titles often appear semi-transparently or with reduced contrast to emphasize the current selection.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Prioritize Void Black (#111111) for all backgrounds to maintain visual depth and focus.
- Use Exhibition White (#fefefe) exclusively for all text and interactive elements to maintain high contrast and sophistication.
- Employ the ak font family for all typographic elements, leveraging its wide character spacing and varied optical sizes.
- Utilize ak 216px (weight 400, lineHeight 0.80) as a dominant graphic element for hero sections.
- Maintain strict typographic hierarchy by only using ak 58px, weight 400, for major section headings.
- Ensure all interactive text elements use ak 12px, weight 400, in Exhibition White, implying interactivity through context rather than overt styling (like underlines or strong color changes).

### Don't

- Do not introduce any additional background colors; maintain the pure Void Black (#111111) canvas.
- Avoid using drop shadows or excessive borders; depth is established through contrasting type sizes and element placement.
- Do not use highly saturated colors for accents; the aesthetic relies on a monochromatic palette with subtle emphasis.
- Do not apply rounded corners to any UI elements; all corners should be sharp 0px radius.
- Avoid using multiple font families beyond 'ak' and 'gs'; consistency in typography is crucial.
- Do not use generic button styles; interactivity is conveyed through text links and subtle text transformations.

## Imagery

The visual language is characterized by high-fidelity, monochromatic 3D renders of furniture pieces. These images are presented as central, hero elements, often against the deep Void Black background, giving them a sculptural, art-piece quality. They are typically contained within their compositional space without masks or overlapping, serving an explanatory and aesthetic role by showcasing product forms. The density is image-heavy in sections, with large product visuals dominating the screen.

## Layout

The page maintains a full-bleed layout, primarily dark-themed, without a fixed `pageMaxWidth`. The hero section features oversized, visually impactful typography laid over a central 3D product render. Content sections are primarily stacked vertically with generous `sectionGap`s, often presenting text beside or above the product imagery. Navigation is a minimal top bar. The overall impression is one of spaciousness and deliberate presentation, with elements given ample room to breathe within the dark canvas.
