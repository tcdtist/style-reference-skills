### Project Table Row

**Role:** A single row within the tabular project listing.

Text uses NHaasGrotesk, 16px, 400 weight, Pitch Black. The row has a bottom border of 1px solid Pitch Black. Padding of 12px top/bottom and 4px left/right. The labels like 'PROJECT', 'TYPE', 'LOCATION', 'YEAR' use Steel Gray text.

### Project List Item

**Role:** A single project entry in the main list. Behaves like a link.

Displaying 'PAZ Graz Official Graz 2025' like a block link, using 'NHaasGrotesk', 16px, 400 weight, Pitch Black text, with a 1px solid Pitch Black border underneath the entire listing. The `Open Project` text within uses the same styling but with an arrow icon.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Always use 'NHaasGrotesk' as the primary typeface for all text elements.
- Maintain a high-contrast dark theme using Pitch Black (#000000) for backgrounds and primary text.
- Implement borders using 1px solid Pitch Black (#000000) to delineate sections and interactive elements.
- Utilize 0px border-radius for all elements, maintaining sharp, angular forms.
- Apply Steel Gray (#999999) for secondary text such as table headers or metadata.
- Ensure consistent spacing with a base unit derived from 5px for element gaps and 32px for section gaps.
- Use Preview White (#ffffff) for any text appearing directly over photographic or illustrative content.

### Don't

- Do not introduce any background colors other than Pitch Black (#000000) for primary surfaces.
- Avoid using shadows or elevation effects; elements should remain flat against the dark background.
- Do not deviate from the 'NHaasGrotesk' typeface or introduce additional font families.
- Refrain from using any color accents; the palette is strictly achromatic with specific allowances for text over media.
- Do not use rounded corners or any non-zero border-radius on any UI elements.
- Avoid decorative gradients; surfaces should be solid colors.
- Do not introduce unnecessary padding or margin, adhere to the established spacing units.

## Imagery

This site features product/architectural photography exclusively. Images are full-bleed within their sections, presenting stark, uncropped views of built environments. There are no illustrations, icons are minimal and functional (arrows), and there's no lifestyle photography. The imagery serves as direct project showcase rather than decorative atmosphere, often occupying significant visual space.

## Layout

The page primarily uses a full-bleed layout, particularly for hero sections and image showcases. Content sections alternate between full-width black backgrounds and a max-width centered container for text-heavy content or tabular data. Vertical rhythm is maintained by consistent section gaps. Navigation is minimalist, typically a horizontal inline list. The overall arrangement is straightforward and linear, prioritizing content presentation with a clear, functional aesthetic.
