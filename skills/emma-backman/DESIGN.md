### Content List Item

### Footer Info Link

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Prioritize text as the primary visual element; minimize decorative graphics or imagery.
- Use Midnight Void (#000000) as the universal page background.
- Apply Ghost Gray (#666666) for all instances of text, including headings, body copy, and interactive links.
- Maintain a default Soehne 400 font for all text elements.
- Utilize 12px as the standard horizontal padding for content sections and the vertical spacing between most elements.
- Set the primary section gap to 48px for clear content separation.

### Don't

- Do not introduce strong accent colors; rely solely on the monochrome palette.
- Avoid using distinct background colors for cards or elevated surfaces; maintain a flat, unified background.
- Do not vary font weights for emphasis or hierarchy; manage hierarchy through size or implicit structure only.
- Do not apply `border-radius` to any elements; everything should have sharp, implied corners.
- Do not use explicit buttons or strong visual calls to action; all interaction should be text-based with minimal visual cues.

## Imagery

No imagery or graphical elements are present. The visual language is entirely text-based, using typography as the sole means of communication and visual structure. Icons are absent.

## Layout

The page employs a full-bleed, max-width layout with content organized into distinct, left-aligned columns. The hero section is characterized by a prominent heading at the top-left, followed by stacked text-based navigation. Content is presented in multiple vertical columns of text lists. Sections are distinct through consistent vertical spacing (48px section gap). The rhythm is defined by a dense, vertically stacked textual information display, with a simple footer link at the very bottom. The page does not use a centered or alternating content arrangement.
